BINHEX 2.0:

Format is lines of text, with potentially any kind of line-ending format
(CR, LF, CRLF).

First line: a comment beginning with "(This file "
Second line: the file flags, and optional type/creator:
  "#$FFFF"         - contains just flags FFFF (4 ascii hexdigits)
  "#TTTT$FFFF"     - contains flags FFFF, file type TTTT (4 characters)
  "#TTTTCCCC$FFFF" - contains flags FFFF, type TTTT and creator CCCC
  (example: "#APPLmsft$D800" = flags 0xd800, type "APPL" creator 'msft'

Next line:  either ***DATA or ***RESOURCE, to state the beginning of data
            for either the data or resource fork.
Next lines: actual encoded data, which is ascii hex digits (2 per byte).
            finished with the line "***END"
Next line:  either ***DATA or ***RESOURCE, for the fork not already done,
            followed by data as described above.
Next line:  "***CHECKSUM:" and the hex digits for a checksum value, which
            is a single byte wraparound addition of all decoded bytes in
            both forks.

BINHEX 3.0:

This is very similar to the BinHex 2.0 format, except a different encoding
and CRC is introduced. The third line is "***COMPRESSED", then the first
"***DATA" or "***RESOURCE" is the next line.




BINHEX 4.0: [RFC 1741]

The format is processed at three different levels:

   1) 8 bit encoding of the file:

Byte:    Length of FileName (1->63)
Bytes:   FileName ("Length" bytes)
Byte:    Version
Long:    Type
Long:    Creator
Word:    Flags (And $F800)
Long:    Length of Data Fork
Long:    Length of Resource Fork
Word:    CRC
Bytes:   Data Fork ("Data Length" bytes)
Word:    CRC
Bytes:   Resource Fork ("Rsrc Length" bytes)
Word:    CRC

   2) Compression of repetitive characters.

($90 is the marker, encoding is made for 3->255 characters)
00 11 22 33 44 55 66 77   -> 00 11 22 33 44 55 66 77
11 22 22 22 22 22 22 33   -> 11 22 90 06 33
11 22 90 33 44            -> 11 22 90 00 33 44

The whole file is considered as a stream of bits.  This stream will
be divided in blocks of 6 bits and then converted to one of 64
characters contained in a table.  The characters in this table have
been chosen for maximum noise protection.  The format will start
with a ":" (first character on a line) and end with a ":".
There will be a maximum of 64 characters on a line.  It must be
preceded, by this comment, starting in column 1 (it does not start
in column 1 in this document):
  (This file must be converted with BinHex 4.0)

Any text before this comment is to be ignored.
The characters used are:
 !"#$%&'()*+,-012345689@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNPQRSTUVXYZ[`abcdefhijklmpqr
