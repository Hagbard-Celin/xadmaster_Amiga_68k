		<br>
		Dennis F. Brothers - 13 March 1985 <br>
		</b></font><font face="Garamond"><i>(Revision 1 - 10 April 1985 - Miscellaneous clarifications) <br>
		(Revision 2 - 12 April 1985 - Corrected reversal of icon position
		v,h) <br>
		(Revision 3 - 6 May 1985 - Added processor ID, general cleanup)</i></font></p>
		<p><font face="Garamond">&nbsp; <br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp; The following notes are a proposal for a standard format for
		binary transfer of arbitrary Macintosh documents via a telecommunication
		link. It is intended for use both between Macintoshes running
		(possibly different) terminal programs which adhere to the standard,
		and for use in uploading arbitrary Macintosh documents to remote
		systems (where it is presumed that they will be stored as an exact
		image of the data transmitted). A proposal is also made for standard
		processing to be performed on text files transferred via a protocol,
		to maximize the likelihood that text files transmitted to a remote
		system will be usable by that system, and that text files received
		from a remote system will be usable by the Macintosh.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp; It is recommended that the format and procedures described
		here be referred to as &quot;MacBinary&quot;, and that any terminal program
		implementing this format and procedures be called &quot;MacBinary-Compatible&quot;.</font></p>
		<p><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp; The binary format described is independent of the communication
		protocol used to accomplish the transfer, and assumes only that
		an 8-bit transparent transfer can be accomplished. Such protocols
		as Christensen (usually referred to as XMODEM or MODEM7), Kermit,
		and CompuServe A or B meet this requirement. Because of the proposed
		standard's MacTerminal/XMODEM heritage, there is a requirement
		that the transmitted data be padded (with nulls) to a 128-byte
		boundary at certain points, but this in no way implies that a
		block-oriented protocol must be used. The basic format proposed
		is identical to that used by MacTerminal, by Mike Boich and Martin
		Haeberli, and can be used with a version of MacTerminal that has
		had a patch applied to &quot;normalize&quot; its implementation of the XMODEM
		protocol. </font></p>
		<p><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp; In brief, the binary format consists of a 128-byte header containing
		all the information necessary to reproduce the document's directory
		entry on the receiving Macintosh; followed by the document's Data
		Fork (if it has one), padded with nulls to a multiple of 128 bytes
		(if necessary); followed by the document's Resource Fork (again,
		padded if necessary). The lengths of these forks (either or both
		of which may be zero) are contained in the header. </font></p>

					<p><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that it is the responsibility of the receiving terminal
					program to resolve file name conflicts, generally by somehow modifying
					the name of received file if there already exists a file with
					the original name on the target volume.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp; Note also that, while the original window or folder ID and
					position may be transmitted, the receiving terminal program would
					not normally set these items for the received file, but would
					instead accept the values that the File Manager assigns when it
					creates the new file.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp; It is suggested that Macintosh terminal programs implement
					two modes of protocol transfer: text and document. Text mode is
					used for unformatted files of type TEXT (with only a data fork),
					and document mode (using the binary format proposed here) is used
					for all other files. Document mode may also be used on text files,
					of course, if it is desired to preserve such things as the file's
					creator ID or creation date.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp; The intent of text mode is to provide compatibility with text
					files on other systems. Toward that end, it is recommended that
					a linefeed be inserted after each return character as the text
					file is transmitted, and that, in the case of block-oriented protocols,
					the last block be explicitely padded with nulls if the text does
					not end on a block boundary. When receiving in text mode, linefeeds
					and trailing nulls should be stripped. If a CTRL-Z (Hex 1A) character
					is received following all other text (and before any null padding),
					it should also be stripped (Ctrl-Z is a common text terminator
					on CP/M and smoe other systems). Note that the above discussion
					applies only to text files transferred under some protocol, where
					an exact image of the transmitted data will be stored in a file
					on the remote system.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp; When receiving a file via a protocol, a terminal program may
					distinguish between text and document modes by examining bytes
					0, 74, and 82 of the first 128 bytes received. If they are each
					zero (and at least 128 bytes have been received), then it is a
					safe assumption that a MacBinary-formatted document is being received.
					Terminal programs implementing possible future versions of the
					proposed standard would, of course, accept an appropriate set
					of version numbers in byte 0. Note also that compatible extensions
					of Version 0 of the proposed standard are possible (one such is
					suggested below) that involve transmission of additional information
					following the information described here. For this reason, a terminal
					program should be implemented so as to perform the proper receive
					procedures for all data sent to it, but to ignore any data that
					it does not know what to do with.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp; Since a text-mode document does not contain a file name, it
					is suggested that when text-mode is detected, a file be opened
					under a dummy name on the receiving Macintosh, the text written
					to that file, and the file renamed to a name selected by the user
					(via an SFPutFile box) after the reception is completed. This
					will avoid problems caused by indeterminate delays for name selection
					at the beginning of the file transfer.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp; It is desirable to allow the user to specify the destination
					volume in advance of the actual start of transfer for either type
					of transfer. Two methods are suggested for this: provide a &quot;Select
					Destination Volume&quot; menu selection, presumably in the menu containing
					the &quot;Receive File&quot; selection; or query the user immediately after
					the &quot;Receive File&quot; menu selection is made. Either or both of these
					methods could be implemented in a given terminal program - the
					independent &quot;Select Receive Volume&quot; method is particularly desirable
					if the ESC-a/ESC-b automatic receive facility (see below) is implemented.
					The volume selection procedure should provide the same functions
					as the volume selection portion of the SFGetFile and SFPutFile
					dialog boxes.</font></p>
					<br>
					<p><font face="Garamond"><b>First proposed extension to the proposed standard: <br>
					</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is proposed that the binary format described above be extended
					to allow the transmission of descriptive text with a Macintosh
					document (specifically, the descriptive text from the Finder's
					&quot;Get Info&quot; box for the file being transferred). This is to be
					accomplished in a transparent manner by assigning bytes 99 and
					100 of the header described above to be used to hold the length
					of the descriptive text (or zero, if there is none). The descriptive
					text, if any, will begin on the 128-boundary immediately following
					the Resource Fork, if present, else the Data Fork, if present,
					else immediately following the header if neither fork is present.
					It is hoped that methods for reading and setting a file's &quot;Get
					Info&quot; text will be made public at some point.</font></p>
					<br>
					<p><font face="Garamond"><b>Notes on MacTerminal's XMODEM implementation, and a proposed extension:
					<br>
					</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Familiarity with the Christensen (XMODEM) protocol is assumed
					in the following discussion. <br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp; When doing &quot;Mac-to-Mac&quot; transfers, using the binary format
					described above, unmodified MacTerminal does not use a true XMODEM
					protocol, and is therefore incompatible with most non-Mac systems.
					The differences lie in two specifics: the transmitting Macintosh
					initiates the transfer by sending the the two characters ESCAPE
					(hex 1B) and &quot;a&quot; (hex 61); the receiving Macintosh is expected
					to reply with the character ACK (hex 06). The transfer then proceeds
					using normal XMODEM procedures, except that each of the header
					and the two forks (if present) is treated as a separate XMODEM
					transfer, with the transmitting Macintosh waiting for a NAK (hex
					15), then sending the blocks of that phase (beginning with a block
					number of one), then sending EOT (hex 04) and waiting for an ACK
					(hex 06) from the receiving Macintosh.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp; It is proposed that a modified procedure be accepted as a standard,
					to be implemented instead of or in addition to the above-described
					MacTerminal &quot;Mac-to-Mac&quot; protocol in complying terminal programs.
					The modified procedure, which is compatible with standard XMODEM
					implementations, functions as follows: The transmitting Macintosh
					sends the two characters ESCAPE (hex 1B) and &quot;b&quot; (hex 62). The
					receiving Macintosh may optionally reply with ACK (hex 06) (this
					is allowed so as to have minimum impact on existing MacTerminal-compatible
					implementations). The transmitting Macintosh then awaits receipt
					of a NAK (hex 15) (or optionally a &quot;C&quot; (hex 43), if the receiving
					terminal program supports CRC checking), following which a single,
					normal XMODEM transfer occurs. The transfer may be in text mode
					or document mode, will begin with block number one, and block
					numbers will increment uniformly (modulo 256) throughout the transfer.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp; It is expected that a patch to MacTerminal making it compatible
					with the above proposed procedure will be available in the near
					future.</font></p>
