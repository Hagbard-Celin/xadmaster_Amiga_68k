Here is a list of sources of image compression hardware (JPEG, MPEG,
H.261 and others), reposted with the author's permission.  The list is
certainly dated already, but it is a good starting point for
seeking compression chips. (Please send corrections/additions to
jloup at gzip.org). References are taken from:
