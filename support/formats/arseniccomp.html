<h1>Stuffit Method 15 compression format</h1>
<p>
Stuffit method 15 (internally called "Arsenic", possibly standing for
some combination of Arithmetic, RLE and block_s_orting) is the method used
for "best compression" by current (as of 2 July 2002) versions of the
Stuffit engine.  It uses an virtual queue arithmetic coder
similar to that used by Mahesh Naik in his Multiprecision Arithmetic
Coder Module (MACM).  Several different models are used, and the input
to the coder is the output of a Burrows-Wheeler transform (blocksort).
The parameters of the block sort are themselves compressed with the
arithmetic coder, though the compression gain of doing so is trivial
at best.
</p>
<h2>The Coder</h2>
<p>
The coder is mathematically equivalent to the MACM with a variable
number of bits of precision, but the order of operations (and hence
the rounding) is different, and there is a small change (for the worse)
in the DecodeRange function.
</p>
<h3> Decoder pseudocode </h3>
<pre>
Parameters:
nbits = 26;
One = 1<<(nbits - 1);
Half = 1<<(nbits - 2);
</pre>
<pre>
Initialization:<code>
Range = One
Code = 0;
for i = 1 to nbits
  Code = (Code << 1) | getbit()
endfor
</code></pre>
<pre>
Decode a frequency:
<code>frequency = Code / (Range / symtot);
// MACM uses ((Code + 1) * symtot - 1) / Range
// and thus avoids the necessity of ever having a code of One.
</code></pre>
<pre>
Remove symbol (Renormalize):<code>
lowincr = (Range / symtot) * symlow; 
  // The lowincr value is mathematically the same as 
  // (Range * symlow)/symtot as in MACM, but different due to rounding 
  // and overflow
Code -= lowincr;
if (symhigh == symtot)
  Range -= lowincr;
else
  Range = (symhigh - symlow) * (Range/symtot)
// The "if" and "else" formulations are the same, excepting roundoff

while ( Range <= Half) {
  Range = Range << 1;
  Code = (Code << 1) | getbit();
}
</code></pre>
<h2>The Models</h2>
<p>
Each model used by the Arsenic coder has the following parameters
<ul>
<li>symtot: Total frequency of all symbols in model</li>
<li>increment: Amount to increase a frequency when a symbol is found</li>
<li>freqlimit: Maximum frequency 'symtot' can reach before reducing
               the model. (that is no reduction until symtot >
	       freqlimit) </li>
<li>symbols: Values of the symbols to be output</li>
<li>frequencies: Frequencies for each symbol.  The initial frequency
is the same for all symbols, and is equal to the increment<br>
(alternatively and as in MACM, cumulative frequencies for each symbol
can be kept, with a 0 for the first symbol, to give the symlow
values.  The symhigh values would be symlow for the next symbol up,
with symtot being the last symhigh)
</li>
</ul>

<p>Reduction of the model is accomplished by dividing all the frequencies
by 2 (with rounding) and recalculating 'symtot'.
</p>

<p>
The initial model is a binary one:
<ul>
<li>symtot: 2</li>
<li>increment: 1</li>
<li>Symbols: (0,1)</li>
<li>freqlimit: 256</li>
</ul>
Other models are
<ul>
<li>The selector model
<ul>
<li>symtot: 88</li>
<li>increment: 8</li>
<li>Symbols: (0..10) </li>
<li>freqlimit: 1024</li>
</ul>
<li>Model 3
<ul>
<li>symtot: 16</li>
<li>increment: 8</li>
<li>Symbols: (2,3) </li>
<li>freqlimit: 1024</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Model 4
<ul>
<li>symtot: 16</li>
<li>increment: 4</li>
<li>Symbols: (4..7) </li>
<li>freqlimit: 1024</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Model 5
<ul>
<li>symtot: 32</li>
<li>increment: 4</li>
<li>Symbols: (8..15) </li>
<li>freqlimit: 1024</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Model 6
<ul>
<li>symtot: 64</li>
<li>increment: 4</li>
<li>Symbols: (16..31) </li>
<li>freqlimit: 1024</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Model 7
<ul>
<li>symtot: 64</li>
<li>increment: 2</li>
<li>Symbols: (32..63) </li>
<li>freqlimit: 1024</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Model 8
<ul>
<li>symtot: 128</li>
<li>increment: 2</li>
<li>Symbols: (64..127) </li>
<li>freqlimit: 1024</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Model 9
<ul>
<li>symtot: 128</li>
<li>increment: 1</li>
<li>Symbols: (128..255) </li>
<li>freqlimit: 1024</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Decoding</h2>
<p>
All values should be read least significant bit first.  Start by
reading 8 bits from the arithcoder using the initial model. The result
should be 0x41.  Then read another 8 bits; this should be 0x73. (thus
"As", the chemical symbol for Arsenic)  Then
read 4 more bits; this is a code for the block size for the
blocksorter &mdash; specifically, it is (log<sub>2</sub> block_size) - 9. 
The block size must be between 2<sup>9</sup> and 2<sup>24</sup>
inclusive.
</p>
<p>
Following the block size code are the blocks.  Decoding proceeds by
processing each block in turn until the end-of-file block is reached.
For each block, the selector model and models 3-9 are re-initialized,
as is the MTF decoder.
</p>
<p>
Each block has a block
header encoded with the initial model:
</p>
<pre>
First bit: 1 for end-of-file (no more bits), 0 normally.
Second bit: 1 for randomization, 0 normally.
Blockbits bits: Index of last character for block sort
</pre>
<p>
Directly following this is the block data, encoded with a variety of
models as well as move-to-front and zero suppression.  To decode this,
read a symbol with the selector model.  A selector of 10 means you are at
the end of the block.  A selector of 2 means to use a literal 1 as the
input to your move-to-front decoder.  A selector between 3 and 9 means to read another
symbol using the model number corresponding to the selector, and use
that as input to your move-to-front decoder.  A selector of 0 or 1
means to start counting zeros. 
</p>
<h3>Zero Counting</h3>
You'll need two variables &mdash; your zero_count and your zero_state.
Both start out set to 0.  When you get a selector 0, set your 
zero_state to 1 and your zero_count to 1.  When you get a selector 1,
set your zero_state to 1 and your zero_count to 2.  Continue 
reading using the selector model.  Each time you get a 0 or a 1,
double the zero_state.  Each time you get a 0, add the new zero_state
to the zero_count.  Each time you get a 1, add twice the new zero
state to the zero_count.  When your zero_state is nonzero and you get
a selector other than 0 or 1 (including 10, end of block), immediately
(before processing that selector)
send a number of zeros equal to your zero_count to your MTF decoder,
and reset the zero_state to 0.
</p>
<h3>Transforming</h3>
<p>
Once you've read the EOF selector, you have the actual length of
the block (if you were counting as you fed them to your MTF decoder), the index
of the last character, and the BWT last column output.  This is
sufficient to do an inverse BWT, and recover the input to the
transform.  The BWT is the standard BWT which wraps at the end of a
string, not the Dr. Dobbs version with an implicit high-value
character at the end of the string.<br>
(needless to say, if the actual length of the block is greater than
the block size indicated in the header, you have corrupt data)
</p>
<h3>Randomization</h3>
<p>
Like BZIP2, in order to avoid repetitive sequences, Arsenic has the
option of applying a "randomization" (something of a misnomer) to the
data.  If the randomization bit is set, then after the inverse BWT on
the data, do the following:
<pre><code>
rndindex = 0;
blockptr = block;
blockend = block + blocklength;

blockptr += rndtable[rndindex];
while (blockptr < blockend) {
  *blockptr ^= 1; /* not *blockptr++ */
  rndindex++;
  if (rndindex == sizeof(rndtable)/sizeof(rndtable[0]))
    rndindex = 0;
  blockptr += rndtable[rndindex];
}
</code></pre>
</p>
<h3>The final RLE</h3>
<p>That's not quite the end, though, because another RLE process
was applied in compression before the BWT and randomization.  This is
a "byte stuffing"
RLE.  Runs of 3 identical symbols or less are unchanged.  Runs of
4-255 symbols are replaced with a run of 4 symbols followed by a byte
indicating the length of the remaining run.  A run of N symbols, N &gt; 255
is encoded just like a run of 255 symbols followed by a run of N-255
symbols.  (While the scheme should allow for runs of 259 symbols to be
encoded as one run, these have not been observed and are assumed to be
illegal).  It is unknown if this RLE is applied on a per-block basis
or if it is applied to the whole file, though per-block seems most
likely. Decoding is simple; any time you see a run of 4 symbols, take
the next symbol as a repeat count and repeat the last symbol that
number of times.  Finally, you have your uncompressed output.
(note that this final RLE decoding is easily combined with the derandomization)
</p>
<h2>CRC</h2>
Following the last block are 32 bits compressed with the initial
model.  This is the standard (used by PKZIP, Ethernet, etc) 32 bit CRC of the
uncompressed data, stored least-significant-bit first.  (Polynomial
0x04c11db7, reflection: yes, initial value = 0xFFFFFFFF, final XOR =
0xFFFFFFFF)
