If you notice any mistakes or omissions, please let me know!  It is only
with YOUR help that the list can continue to grow.  Please send
all changes to me rather than distributing a modified version of the list.

This file has been authored in the style of the INTERxxy.* file list
by Ralf Brown, and uses almost the same format.

Please read the file FILEFMTS.1ST before asking me any questions. You may find
that they have already been addressed.

DISCLAIMER:  THIS MATERIAL IS PROVIDED "AS IS".  I verify the information
contained in this list to the best of my ability, but I cannot be held
responsible for any problems caused by use or misuse of the information,
especially for those file formats foreign to the PC, like AMIGA or SUN file
formats. If an information it is marked "guesswork" or undocumented, you
should check it carefully to make sure your program will not break with
an unexpected value (and please let me know whether or not it works
the same way).

Information marked with "???" is known to be incomplete or guesswork.

Some file formats were not released by their creators, others are regarded
as proprietary, which means that if your programs deal with them, you might
be looking for trouble. I don't care about this.

The ZOO archive program by Raoul Dhesi is a file compression program now
superceeded in both compression and speed by most other compression programs.
The archive header looks like this :
OFFSET              Count TYPE   Description
0000h                  20 char   Archive header text, ^Z terminated, null padded
0014h                   1 dword  ID=0FDC4A7DCh
0018h                   1 dword  Offset of first file in archive
001Ch                   1 dword  Offset of ????
0020h                   1 byte   Version archive was made by
0021h                   1 byte   Minimum version needed to extract

Each stored file has its own header, which looks like this :
OFFSET              Count TYPE   Description
0000h                   1 dword  ID=0FDC4A7DCh
0004h                   1 byte   Type of directory entry
0005h                   1 byte   Compression method :
                                 0 - stored
                                 1 - Crunched : LZW, 4K buffer,
                                                 var len (9-13 bits)
0006h                   1 dword  Offset of next directory entry
000Ah                   1 dword  Offset of next header
000Dh                   1 word   Original date / time of file (see table 0009)
0012h                   1 word   CRC-16 of file
0014h                   1 dword  Uncompressed size of file
0018h                   1 dword  Compressed size of file
001Ch                   1 byte   Version this file was compressed by
001Dh                   1 byte   Minimum version needed to extract
001Eh                   1 byte   Deleted flag
                                 0 - file in archive
                                 1 - file is considered deleted
001Fh                   1 dword  Offset of comment field, 0 if none
