Subject: Long File Name format

Long file names are quite simple.  Windows simply creates multiple entries
for each file with a long name.  The entries are tagged with every
attribute, including (and this is the key) the volume attribute.  Windows
sees this, and chains the entries together to make one long file name.  The
only directory entry that doesn't have all the attributes set is the short
filename, which is the only one that makes any sense to DOS, so that's the
only one it displays when you type "dir"
